I read a second novel by Andy Weir. His science fiction is still relatively easy to understand, without any particularly profound concepts. The story creates a crisis environment and uses basic physics concepts to solve problems step by step.

The protagonist is not a hero who sacrifices everything to save the world, and is even timid. However, he remains a person of integrity, always acting for the benefit of the world when faced with difficult decisions.

In the end, he proves more decisive in saving his friends than in saving the world itself.

The final ending is quite interesting, avoiding depictions of a devastated Earth or a hero's return. Instead, it opens up a whole new world.

And until the very end, the protagonist remains just an ordinary teacher.
