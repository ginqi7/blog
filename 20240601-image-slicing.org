#+title: Image Slicing
#+filetags: :emacs:project:
#+DATE: 2024-06-01

* Overview
In Emacs, displaying an image occupies one line regardless of its height. The movement over the image while navigating by lines can be quite frustrating.

Although [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/pixel-scroll.el][pixel-scroll]] and [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/lisp/pixel-scroll.el][iscroll]] have improved image movement to some extent.

I hope to move images in the same way as moving text, line by line.

So I created this package to horizontally slice the images referenced in the buffer into multiple images. In Emacs, only a portion of the original image is displayed on each line. Finally, the image can be moved line by line.

During the development process, I found [[https://github.com/jcfk/org-sliced-images][org-sliced-images]] which was almost the same as my idea. And thanks to him for letting me know about =insert-sliced-image= in Emacs.

* Prerequisites

** CLI
*Curl*: Used to download remote images.

** Require Packages
+ *org-element*: Used to parse the buffer to retrieve all links.
+ *image*: Used to create an image object.
+ *url-util* : A utility for handling URL formats.

** Install
+ clone the project in your own emacs configuration files directory, like:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone git@github.com:ginqi7/image-slicing.git ~/.emacs.d/lisp/image-slicing
#+END_SRC

+ add the path to 'load-path'
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/lisp/d/lisp/image-slicing"))
#+END_SRC

* Configuration
Here are a few variables that can be used for configuration:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'image-slicing)
#+end_src

** Variables
| variable                            |                      default value | explain                                               |
|-------------------------------------+------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------|
| image-slicing-download-concurrency  |                                 20 | the maximum concurrency of images download            |

| image-slicing-cursor-fringe-bitmaps | '(left-fringe right-arrow warning) | the Fringe Bitmaps indicator for the cursor position.[fn:1] |



** EWW Config
1. cancel the eww defualt image render.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'shr-external-rendering-functions
             '(img . image-slicing-tag-img))
#+end_src
2. Add ~image-slicing~ to ~eww-after-render-hook~
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(push #'image-slicing-mode eww-after-render-hook)
#+end_src

** Elfeed Config
image-slice can also work with elfeed:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; add to shr-external-rendering-functions (skip if alread setup for eww)
  (add-to-list 'shr-external-rendering-functions
               '(img . image-slicing-tag-img))

  ;; advice `elfeed-show-entry' to trigger `image-slicing-mode'
  (advice-add #'elfeed-show-entry :after #'image-slicing-mode)
#+end_src


* Features

- =image-slicing-mode=: Automatically finds image links in the buffer and renders them as multiline display.
- =Asynchronous=: Asynchronous download of remote images.
- =Multiple Modes=: Support multiple modes like org-mode, eww, elfeed.


** Supported Link Format
- Org Links
  - =[[url][tag]]=
  - =[[url]]=
- Pure Links
  - =file:./hello.png=
  - =http://image.png=
- EWW Html Links
  - <img src=''>
  - Support base64 formatted images

* Example

[[https://github.com/ginqi7/image-slicing/raw/main/screencast.gif]]

* Disadvantages

- If there are many remote image links in the buffer, it will generate many temporary image files in the temporary system directory.
- If the URL link is too short, the number of slices of the original image will be small, and the image line height will be large.
- Only one buffer can be rendered at a time.


* Todo List
- Adapt nov


* Development History
** Dec 18, 2024

I find a similar package named [[https://github.com/jcfk/org-sliced-images][org-sliced-images]], so I study some code from it to make my code simpler.

In Emacs, we can display a part of an image by using ('display . (list (list 'slice x y dx dy) image)), without needing to actually slice the image using ImageMagick, so I remove the dependency about ImageMagick.


** Dec 16, 2024
There have some issues in last version:
1. There is slow when ImageMagick handle remote images.
2. Though I will delete the placeholders when the user removes the overlays, there is still a risk of polluting the users' buffer.

So I use asynchronous processes to run ImageMagick, guaranteeing that it will not freeze Emacs. On the other hand, I removed the placeholder and just placed some overlays on the original URL text.


** May 12, 2023

I got the idea to slice the image into many pieces, making Emacs display the pieces line by line.

1. Use the CLI /[[https://imagemagick.org/][ImageMagick]]/ to slice images.
2. Insert some special text like "__#_#_@@_#_#__" as placeholder, and put an overlay on that placeholder to show image pieces.
