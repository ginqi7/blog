It's like when you invite someone to play chess with you. You are full of enthusiasm and think that the other person is also enjoying it. Until the end, when he pushes the chessboard away and leaves, you realize that he was bored and couldn't bear it anymore. Looking back at the chess game, you can see his emotions everywhere, but you didn't notice it at all. The reason is that you thought you had similar interests, while he thought he could tolerate it. In the end, when the chess game is over, one person is full of complaints, while the other is confused. If you had communicated your thoughts from the beginning, the outcome might have been different.
